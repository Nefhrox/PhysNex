# PhysNex
Website for everyone who enjoys physics

The idea of this webpage is to create place like "leetcode" but for physics

I want to create a list of physics topics, each with a set of problems divided by difficulty and level of understanding.


What already done:

Different problems types such as: calculation, theoretical, graphical.

Difficulty gradation: every problem have own difficulty from 1 to 10.

Problems tracking: integrated local storage to keep track of completed problems.

Search function: you can search for topics, sub-topics and problems on main page. Also it shows problems difficulty, type and completion status.

Automation scripts such as problem creator(creates all main code automatically only text of a problem, solution and answer is needed), problem template(rewrite all problems in topic if there are any changes of problem code), sub-topic creator

Page for constants and formulae 


Current plans for this project:


Formula recall
